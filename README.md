# Project: SimplySend
## Description

SimplySend is a messaging app where users can sign up with an email address, add other users, and message away

### Motivation

While brainstorming different ideas for projects, I was messaging some friends about plans for the later evenings, when it dawned on me that with different friends, different methods/apps were used to communicate with them. The reasons were that one person had an iPhone in contrast to an iPhone or this person preferred the functionality of this app over another. Which brought up a question, "Is there an messaging app that can satisfy all my friends?" And thus came SimplySend.

Also, the framework Django was used because this project also develops deeper learning of the framework and usage of python

### Lessons Learned

- Be specific and concise and defining a model and what they contain
- Authentication and validation are very important and there are many ways of implementing both
