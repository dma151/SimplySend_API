## Code Snippet

The largest amount of time I spent for this project would probably go to this snippet of code. I did not know how to initialize the Conversation Model that only had a foreign key as a field inside with 2 participating users. After countless hours of research I had to simply redefine the create method for the Serializer and also use a new type of serializer we haven't used in class

```
    class FriendSerializer(serializers.StringRelatedField):
        def to_internal_value(self, value):
            return value
```
```
    def create(self, validated_data):
        print(validated_data)
        participants = validated_data.pop('participants')
        conversation = Conversation()
        conversation.save()
        for email in participants:
            participant = get_object_or_404(User, email=email)
            conversation.participants.add(participant)
        conversation.save()
        return conversation
```

## Future Changes

- Deconstruct the participants and create a contact model thats related to the user model
- Change backend message authors to their emails
- Change the styling and colors of the messages/conversations so its more aesthetically appealing
- Fully implement the CRUD functionality in the front end for conversations and friends
- Upgrade the rendering of the friends list, conversation list, and messages with constant updates
